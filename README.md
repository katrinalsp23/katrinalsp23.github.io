This project has been made in collaboration with Rijksmuseum van Oudheden for a course at Hogeschool Leiden. During this project, a boardgame with educational purposes was created for the museum with a corresponding website. 

The website is accessible at https://katrinalsp23.github.io. 

De website generates a code from the user, namely the code 6650. Go to the page 'quiz' and type in the code 6650 in the input box. Then, the quiz will appear.
